        "description": "The sprawling Sahara Desert spans more than 3.5 million square miles and is the largest hot desert in the world. Covering much of northern Africa, it reaches three major bodies of water: the Atlantic Ocean in the west, the Red Sea in the east, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. To the south is the Sahei region. The Sahara’s harsh environment is characterized by vast sand dunes, arid plains, and rocky plateaus. The tallest sand dune is located in the Erg Chebbi region of southeastern Morocco and reaches a height of roughly 330 feet. The desert plays an important role in shaping climate patterns and ecological systems.\n\nFormed over the course of millions of years and dating back to the Precambrian era, the Sahara was once a lush, verdant landscape with lakes and rivers. Over many years, wind erosion has sculpted towering cliffs, rock arches, deep canyons and many striking and picturesque landforms. Beneath a surface composed of gravel plains and sand seas lies vast underground aquifers that store ancient water, hidden remnants of a time when the Sahara was a much more hospitable place.\n\nWhile the Sahara experiences extreme temperatures and has scarce rainfall, it supports a variety of plant and animal life that have adapted to the harsh conditions. The sparse vegetation includes drought-tolerant varieties such as desert grasses such as Lovegrass that can store water in their roots and help prevent soil erosion. Other vegetation includes Acacia trees, date palms, and olive trees. Animal life has also adapted to be able to endure the extreme heat and extended periods of time with little or no water. Fennec foxes, camels, addax, and scorpions are some examples of the species found in the Sahara. Many animals have made nocturnal adaptations in order to remain hidden during the high daytime temperatures. Many migratory birds pass through the region and take advantage of seasonal water sources and oases.",

The Serengeti sits atop Precambrian rock formations and supports vast herds of herbivores with abundant grasses. The Mara and Grumeti rivers carve their way through he plains, providing crucial water supplies to sustain wildlife year-round.\n\nThe Serengeti is home to one of Africa’s highest concentrations of large mammal species, including elephants, giraffes, hyenas, lions, and zebras. Every year, more than a million wildebeest make a circular migration across the Serengeti Plains, following seasonal rains. Their grazing and trampling of grass allow new grasses to grow, while their wast helps fertilize the soil.",

The vibrant house of the canyon, ranging from deep reds and oranges to subtle shades of purple, it is an iconic natural wonder.\n\nThe geological story that the canyon tells spans nearly two billion years.

The much younger Kaibab Limestone formation on the rim is the canyon’s top most rock layer, dating back a mere 270 million years. Between these two extremes, wind and water erosion have sculpted stunning cliffs, mesas, and buttes to create an intricate landscape of canyons within canyons. Every year, the seasonal variations in the Colorado River’s flow continue to carve the canyons deeper and deeper.\n\nJust as the geology story shifts with the altitude change, the plant and animal diversity changes dramatically. Flora ranges from desert species such as cacti and junipers to high-elevation forests of spruce fir or ponderosa pine, groundsels, yarrow, and lupine. Bighorn sheep, mule deer, and the elusive mountain lion are just some of the wildlife species that make their home in this ecological treasure.",

        "description": "Comprised of over 2,900 individual reefs, 900 islands, and spanning a monumental 133,000 square miles, the Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest coral reef system. Situated in the Coral Sea just off the coast of Queensland, Australia, the Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest single structure made by living organisms. It’s large enough to be seen from space.\n\nThe reef system supports a dizzying range of diverse life, including many species that are vulnerable or endangered, and some are endemic to the area. Dozens of cetaceans including dwarf minke whale, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and the humpback whale live here. Clownfish, snapper, and coral trout are just some of the 1,500 fish species found in the waters surrounding the reef.\n\nSometimes overshadowed by the magnificent aquatic animal life, the Great Barrier Reef is home to over 2,000 species of native plants. Seagrass meadows are one of the most fundamental parts of the flora found in the reef system.  Eelgrass or Turtle grass meadows thrive in the shallow coastal waters and help to maintain the biodiversity, stability, and productivity of the reef.",

        "description": "The South Shetland Islands consist of 11 major islands and several minor ones, making up more than 1,400 square miles of land area. The Antarctic island chain is located in the Drake Passage. Almost all of the land area is permanently covered by glaciers.  Active geothermal vents and hot springs provide balance the two contrasting extremes of fire and ice.\n\nVarious plants have adapted to the harsh conditions, including two flowering plants — the Antarctic hair grass and Antarctic pearlwort. Other examples of adapted plants include mosses, liverworts, lichens, and fungi. Notable penguin species include Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Crabeater, Leopard, Weddell, and fur seals are some of the island’s other inhabitants.",
